This is Mutation Testing with `Infection` right in your browser!

You can write the code, write the tests, click `Run` and see Mutation Testing results.

Here are several reasons for what Infection Playground can be used for:

* to spread mutation testing across more people
* to make it unbelievable easy to try Mutation Testing in PHP - right in your browser. No projects to create locally, no need to install `Composer`, `Infection`, `PHPUnit` - nothing. Just type a couple of lines of the source code, write a test and click `Run`.
* to provide people a good tool to report issues for `Infection`. We hope it will be easier for developers to just create an example on https://infection-php.dev site and post a permanent link to GitHub's issue rather than creating standalone repository or even worse not giving an example at all
* to show real examples for the documentation, e.g. Mutators. These are for [PublicVisibility](https://infection-php.dev/r/qxk) and [ProtectedVisibility](https://infection-php.dev/r/j0l)

Try it. Share your results with colleagues. Experiment with it!
