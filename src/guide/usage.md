## Configuration

The first time you run Infection for your project, it will ask you several questions to create a config file `infection.json.dist`, with the following structure:

``` json
{
    "source": {
        "directories": [
            "src"
        ],
        "excludes": [
            "Config",
            "Folder/with/File.php"
        ]
    },
    "timeout": 10,
    "logs": {
        "text": "infection-log.txt",
        "summary": "summary-log.txt",
        "debug": "debug-log.txt",
        "perMutator": "per-mutator.md"
    },
    "tmpDir": "/opt/tmp-folder",
    "phpUnit": {
        "configDir": "app",
        "customPath": "\/path\/to\/phpunit-6.1.phar"
    }
    "mutators": {
        "@default": true,
        "@function_signature": false,
        "TrueValue": {
            "ignore": [
            "NameSpace\\*\\Class::method"
            ]
        }
    },
    "testFramework":"phpsec",
    "bootstrap":"./tests/bootstrap.php"
}
```

You can commit it to the VCS and, if necessary, override it locally by creating `infection.json` which should be ingored (e.g. in `.gitignore`).

### Configuration settings

* `source` section:
  * `directories` - array, contains all folders with source code you want to mutate. Can be `.`, but make sure to exclude `vendor` in this case.
  * `excludes` - array, contains all folders or files you want to exclude withing your source folders. You can use glob pattern (`*Bundle/**/*/Tests`) for them as well as everything that accepts Symfony Finder's [notPath()](http://api.symfony.com/4.0/Symfony/Component/Finder/Finder.html#method_notPath) method - path or regular expression. In order to skip all files containing `.interface.php` in the name, you would write it as `"excludes": ["/\\.interface\\.php/"]`
  Infection automatically excludes `vendor`, `test`, `tests` folders if the source folder is `.` (current dir). Make sure to not mutate your test suite. 
* `timeout` - the allowed timeout configured for Infection. Make sure to set it to higher value than your tests are executed in seconds to avoid false-positives.
* `logs`
  * `text` - human readable text log file. Must see to understand what is going on during mutation process.
  * `summary` - summary log file, which will only tell display the amount of mutants per category, (Killed, Errored, Escaped, Timed Out & Not Covered)
  * `debug` - debug log file, which displays what mutations were found on what line, per category.
  * `perMutator` - a markdown file which will give a break-down of the effectiveness of each mutator.
* `tmpDir` - Optional. It's a folder where Infection creates its configs, caches and other stuff. It may be useful for people who doesn't have access to the default system temporary folder and/or doesn't have write permissions. Either absolute `/tmp/folder` or relative `var/cache` paths can be used.
* `phpUnit` - optional key
  * `configDir` - custom directory path with `phpunit.xml.dist` file. This is useful for example for old Symfony app, where `phpunit.xml.dist` is located at `./app`
  * `customPath` - custom path to PHPUnit executable. This is useful when you run tests by external shared phar file that is located outside project root.
* `mutators`: optional key, it contains the settings for different mutations and profiles, read more about it [here](/guide/profiles.html)
* `testFramework`: optional key, it sets the framework to use for testing. Defaults to `phpunit`. This gets overridden by the `--test-framework` command line argument.
* `bootstrap`: optional key, use to specify a file to include as part of the startup to pre-configure the infection environment. Useful for adding custom autoloaders not included in composer.

#### How to use custom autoloader or bootstrap file

If you have a custom autoloader or bootstrap file for your application, you should tell Infection about it.

For example you have

```php
// custom-autoloader.php

require NonPsr4CompliantFile.php

```

then you have to add it to the `infection.json` file:

```json
{
    "bootstrap": "./custom-autoloader.php"
}
```

Thus, Infection will know how to autoload `NonPsr4CompliantFile` class. Without adding it to the config, Infection will not be able to create Mutations because internally it uses `new \ReflectionClass()` objects.

## Running Infection

Ensure that your tests are all in a passing state (incomplete and skipped tests are allowed). Infection will quit if any of your tests are failing.

If you have installed Infection as a global composer package, just run it in your project's root:

``` bash
infection
```

or if you cloned it to some folder:

``` bash
# cd /path/to/project/root

~/infection/bin/infection
```

### Running with `phpdbg`

In order to run infection with `phpdbg` instead of xDebug, you need to execute the following command:

```bash
phpdbg -qrr infection.phar
```

## Updating Phar distribution

The phar is signed with an `openssl` private key. You will need the pubkey file to be stored beside the phar file at all times in order to use it. If you rename `infection.phar` to `infection`, for example, then also rename the key from `infection.phar.pubkey` to `infection.pubkey`.

To update your current phar, just run:

``` bash
./infection.phar self-update
```

<p class="tip">Note: Using a phar means that fixes may take longer to reach your version, but there's more assurance of having a stable development version. The public key is downloaded only once. It is re-used by self-update to verify future phar releases.</p>

### Updating to pre-release versions

While we recommend to use the most stable releases, you can update it to pre-release version if available

``` bash
./infection.phar self-update --pre
```

### Check availability of new versions

It's possible to check if there is a new version available:

``` bash
./infection.phar self-update --check
```

### Self-Update Request Debugging

If you experience any issues self-updating with unexpected `openssl` or SSL errors, please ensure that you have enabled the `openssl` extension. For example on Windows, you can do this by adding or uncommenting the following line in the `php.ini` file for PHP on the command line (if different than the file for your http server):

``` bash
extension=php_openssl.dll
```
