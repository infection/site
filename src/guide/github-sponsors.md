We help thousands of projects and teams to write more reliable software by improving their test suites.

## Sponsorship Goal

The funds collected will be used to pay for the [project's infrastructure](/guide/infection-playground.html) costs as well as to support the Infection maintainers with funds for swag and travel costs when visiting conferences.
